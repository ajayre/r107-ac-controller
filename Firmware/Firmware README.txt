FIRMWARE
========

To build the firmware you will need:

 - Arduino IDE - https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

 - Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/

 - Install Visual Micro - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualMicro.ArduinoIDEforVisualStudio

Both are free. You will also need:

  - USB to Type A Mini cable

1. Connect the board to your PC

2. Start Visual Studio

3. Open the project, wait for the Visual Micro toolbar to appear

4. Click on the Visual Micro "Build and Upload" button.

Note there are two builds - Debug and Release. The Debug build allows the optional AC simulation and provides more debug output.

Once running you can connect to the COM port at 57,600 baud to see debug output.

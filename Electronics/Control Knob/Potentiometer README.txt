POTENTIOMETER README
====================

The pot is 10KOhm with integrated switch, 1/4" shaft and 300 degrees of rotation.

To install into the existing AC knob:

1. Use a rotary tool, e.g. a Dremel, to cut off the brass tabs holding the rear Ranco unit from the front vacuum unit.

2. Loosen the brass nut inside the vacuum unit and unscrew the brass bracket that held the rear Ranco unit on.

3. Remove the brass washer with the 'D' shaped hole. It sits between the brass nut and the spring.

4. Using a rotary tool carefully enlarge the 'D' shaped hole in the washer until the shaft of the potentiometer fits.

5. Reinstall washer, nut and brass bracket.

6. Turn knob to off position.

7. Turn potentiometer to off position.

8. Screw potentiometer onto 3D printed bracket (use ABS plastic).

9. Remove screw (nearest vacuum cam) holding vacuum valve to body.

9. Insert potentiometer into vacuum unit so the printed bracket sits inside the brass bracket and the shaft of the potentiometer goes into the vacuum cam.

10. Install a new longer screw into vacuum valve so it goes into the 3D printed bracket.

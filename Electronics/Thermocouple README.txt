THERMOCOUPLE
============

A K-type thermocouple is needed. This consists of red and yellow wires inside a braided sheath. It can be purchased by the foot.

1. Push the braiding back at one end to expose about 5mm of bare wires.

2. Using needle-nose pliers tightly twist the bare wires together.

3. Remove the outer braided sheath from a section long enough to go into the evaporator. Use the old capillary tube as a guide to the length.

4. Cover in 2.5mm diameter heat shrink tubing, making sure to cover the end of the braiding so it doesn't fray and also a bit past the tip so the bare wires cannot touch the evaporator.

5. Attach female quick disconnect connectors 0.250", 22 gauge (red) to the ends of each wire.

6. Straighten the wire out as much as possible.

7. Very carefully feed into the evaporator.

NOTE - do this at your own risk! This is what worked for me but I am not responsible if anything gets stuck in your evaporator. If you are not completely comfortable with doing this then look to another solution for measuring the evaporator temperature!

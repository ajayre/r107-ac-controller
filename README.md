# R107/C107 Air Conditioning Controller

This is an AC controller for the original Mercedes-Benz R107/C107 manual climate control system. The original system is identified by four vertical levers.

The problem with the AC switch is the delicate capillary tube that senses the evaporator temperature. With age these become brittle and snap off while working on items in the central console. Once broken they are not repairable. Replacements are not available to purchase.

The aim of this project is to replace the Ranco electro-mechanical part of the AC switch with a modern electronic equivalent.
